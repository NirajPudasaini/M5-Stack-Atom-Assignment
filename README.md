# M5 Stack Atom Assignment

This is a readme file that contains instructions on what to expect while running codes on M5 Stack Atom Matrix.

## Part 1, the first (Bike light) 

After connecting the Atom Matrix with a power source, you can carry out different modes as follows:

* The screen is completely blank at the first mode or all the LEDs are in off state initially.
* After you press the button, LEDs strobe in red color at a predetermined interval of 100 milli seconds.
* Similarly, after pressing button again, LEDs strobe at a predetermined interval of 100 milli seconds, but in white color.
* Now, after the third press of button, the device constantly checks if there is a deacceleration to detect the braking event.
If a braking event is detected then the lights turn solid for that interval then returns to strobe when the devices isn't in braking event.
Red light is used to mimic the Automatic Rear Mode of the vehicle.
* Similar to the previous point, white light turns solid in the braking event, and returns to strobe at other conditions. White light is used to mimic the Automatic Front Mode of the vehicle.


## Part 1, the second (Sensing Temperature)

After connecting the Atom Matrix with a power source, you can carry out different modes as follows: 
In normal operation, the device is measuring temperature and recording it at a predetermined interval, and the
screen displays nothing.
d. When holding the device in the hand with the screen facing relatively upwards, tapping the screen OR pressing the
screen button activates the screen.
e. When the screen is activated, the user is able to change modes between the following by tipping the device left or
right (assuming the bottom of the device is where the USB-C port resides)
f. To activate a given mode, the user either clicks the screen or taps the device.
g. To exit the active display mode, the user turns the device face-down, and the device returns to background reading
mode with screen off.
h. Modes:
i. Show Active temperature + Units
ii. Show average of last 24 hours of temperature + Units
iii. Show color scale of temperature range + current temperature as color
iv. Show graph of temperature across a predefined range.
v. Change units
